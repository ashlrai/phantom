## Install

Canonical Phantom releases use `@ashlr/phantom` from `ashlrai/phantom`.
Install the canonical package's promoted release.
This source tree targets version 3.29.10; check canonical release availability and exact matching assets before installation.

```sh
npm install -g @ashlr/phantom   # `phm` and compatible `ashlr`; Node.js 22.15+ and Git; macOS, Linux, Windows
phm --version             # report the installed version
phm verse                 # start the console at http://127.0.0.1:7777/verse/
```

Current installation uses the promoted npm `latest` release. For a reproducible
install, select a published version from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/releases/latest) and pin
`@ashlr/phantom@<version>`; the source candidate is not proof of publication.

Find current desktop artifacts at [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/releases/latest):
the signed `Phantom_<version>_aarch64.app.tar.gz` archive and paired
[`latest.json`](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/releases/latest/download/latest.json),
rather than a DMG. Match them to the installed CLI version. Qualified releases
from 3.29.8 support `phm desktop install` for a new Apple silicon Mac installation;
see [consumer installation](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/desktop/README.md#consumer-first-install).
Clean-Mac acceptance remains unverified. Existing installations use the qualified signed-update flow. Maintainer
artifact installation requires the original qualified bundle and prior
Stop/drain and Quit; downloading the archive alone is not that installation.
See [desktop installation](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/desktop/README.md#install). The app is locally signed,
not Apple Developer ID notarized. The CLI includes the browser console on macOS, Linux and Windows.
See [desktop installation](#the-desktop-app-macos) or the

## What it is

**Phantom** brings supported coding agents, accounts and local models into one
workbench. Connect eligible Claude Code, Codex, Grok or Devin accounts, configure
an API resource, or use a tool-capable local model. Choose a project and a small,
checkable task; review the changes and results together.

CLI accounts use the vendor's configured account and billing path. API resources
have their own metered billing; local inference uses your hardware. A connected
account does not prove remaining subscription allowance or permission to spend
purchased credits. Check each resource's readiness and budget before delegating.

For unattended work, give the fleet an outcome and observable acceptance
criteria. The **Leader** refines priorities and briefs you in Phantom, Telegram
or the terminal. The fleet works only in enrolled repositories under your
current signed standing grant. A shadow stage records what it would merge;
a judged ladder or eligible elite-direct stage follows the mode you sign.

It ships as a macOS desktop app and as the `phm` CLI (canonical package
`@ashlr/phantom`, also available as `ashlr`), which
serves the same console in a browser on macOS, Linux and Windows. Under the
console is the Phantom kernel: the CLI, the Universe experiment runtime and
account-aware resource pools.

Phantom was formerly Ashlr Verse. The current source repository is `ashlrai/phantom`;
the canonical package is `@ashlr/phantom`. `phm` and compatible `ashlr`
share the same entrypoint. Published 3.25.3 remains `@ashlr/hub`; its existing
SDK imports, including `@ashlr/hub/universe`, retain their original identity.
The canonical package provides the same five SDK surfaces under `@ashlr/phantom`.
Existing manifests, schemas, stores and credentials are not renamed. Published
3.25.3 uses `Phantom.app`; 3.25.0 retains its historical `Ashlr.app` filename. See [branding and compatibility](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/PHANTOM-BRAND.md).

The user guide is [`docs/VERSE.md`](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md).
See [Automatic work](docs/AUTOMATIC-OUTCOMES.md) for chat routing, editable outcomes and recovery.

<a id="whats-in-verse-324"></a>

### What's in Phantom

Choose **Manager** in a chat’s **Auto seat** menu, or **Enable manager** on a
saved Fleet outcome, for planning, delegation and review under the fleet’s
current authority. [Read the Manager guide](docs/AUTOMATIC-OUTCOMES.md#one-conversation-with-the-manager).

**See what is running, what was measured and what still needs permission.**
The desktop can request that the host stay awake during observed local chat and
resident work; cloud-only sessions do not keep the host awake. Resources show
Devin's reported organization consumption separately from tracked ACU budgets.
Growth keeps npm retrievals, GitHub stars, traffic and release downloads in their
own source windows, with stale and unavailable readings explicit.

**Use allowance before resets** has a global setting and per-account overrides.
Off disables reset priority and reserve shrinking. On remains subject to signed
reserve floors, current task fit and verified billing and execution-account
boundaries. This source includes an account-bound native Claude CLI adapter
with isolated filesystem tools; installation and live account acceptance are
separate. Aggressive reset-time reserve shrinking remains held until its
subscription-only execution boundary is verified. Codex, Grok and Devin have
no verified no-spillover boundary here. Purchased credits are excluded.
Grok Bot has an independent weekly allowance; it never inherits Grok Build's
usage or reset. Local CPU, RAM and recorded task speed are visible in Resources;
they are descriptive measurements, not yet host-load-aware routing inputs.
See [resource evidence](docs/RESOURCE-EVIDENCE.md).
See [reset controls](docs/RESET-AWARE-SCHEDULING.md),
[desktop power](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/desktop/README.md#automatic-awake-during-local-work) and
[Growth measurements](docs/VERSE.md#adoption-fixed-public-project-metadata).

**Work with me** opens your interactive chats: guide the agent, inspect its
tools and context, review changes and continue on another account or local model.
**Work for me** opens the fleet: describe a desired result, edit or pause it,
inspect recorded runs and proposals, and guide the Leader within the authority you sign. Both workspaces
share accounts and projects, and switching between them does not start work or
change permission mode. The app restores the workspace you last used.

| Work with me | Work for me |
|---|---|
| Describe work in a project; Automatic chooses an eligible connected resource. Use Advanced for a manual override. | Save a desired result and observable acceptance. The Leader refines dependency-ready work across the fleet. |
| Keep projects, drafts, terminals and source evidence together. | Keep account capacity, goals, outcomes and the work needing you together. |

### How work moves

**Automatic** selects an eligible account and model for a chat. It considers
task fit, available capacity, your preferences, cost basis and observed latency
when available. Configured Jev advice
can inform the choice; it cannot make a blocked resource eligible.

**Manager** coordinates delegation and review for an explicit chat or outcome.
**Leader** sets fleet priorities, refines work and asks for your decisions.
Roles select an eligible account and fitting model rather than a preferred
company. Leader planning and conversation support prepared Claude Code, Codex,
Grok, local models and the included native Devin CLI models. Native roles use
an account-bound dispatcher; Manager stages use qualified worker adapters.
Cloud Devin sessions remain a separately accounted ACU lane. Balanced mode
enables included Codex allowance by default; stored per-account Off settings
remain respected. Each account's
model variants share its allowance, so adding a model never creates quota.

Routing retains current account, context, subscription-only billing and signed
scope evidence. Unknown funding remains unavailable. Native completion traces
record the selected account/model, wall time and reported tokens when present;
whole-run throughput is distinct from generation tokens per second.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Chat[Your chat] --> Auto[Automatic: eligible resource]
  Goal[Your outcome] --> Plan[Leader or enabled Manager: plan]
  Plan --> Queue[Dependency-ready work]
  Queue --> Checks[Capacity, budget and authority checks]
  Checks --> Agents[Eligible agents and local models]

  Agents --> Evidence[Recorded runs, changes and verification]
  Evidence --> Review[Your review or authorized merge checks]
```

Independent ready tasks can use several admitted resources. Serving slots,
account quotas, workspace isolation, budget reserves and signed authority limit
concurrency; **Automatic** counts do not mean unlimited parallel work. Devin
fleet sessions use their separate granted launcher and ACU budget.

Open **Resources** to distinguish chat readiness from fleet readiness and see
reported usage, reset windows and the specific hold. Inspect a turn's tools,
context and sources, then its diff and verification results. Reported readings,
estimates and unknowns stay distinct: a running daemon, completed plan or agent's
success message alone does not prove your outcome was delivered.
See [Automatic work](docs/AUTOMATIC-OUTCOMES.md) for routing, recovery and permissions.

**Review** opens the relevant changes, sources, usage, agents or decisions without
starting another run. Advanced preferences let you choose **No preference limit**
for goal counts, goal creation, Leader daily runs and Grok lanes. Finish-first is
an independent choice; changing a preference does not widen signed authority.

Connected resource rows keep a stable order, show cached readings immediately
when available, with gray **last** meters and original timestamps while live
readings refresh from shared metadata collection. Expand an account
for its actual windows, reset times and freshness. Missing readings remain
unknown. Operator cloud estimates and captured dollar balances have separate
labels. See [resource evidence](docs/RESOURCE-EVIDENCE.md).

The fleet can prioritize useful work before a qualified account deadline.
It compares recorded durations for the same engine, model and task kind,
checks current account headroom, and uses optional Jev advice among eligible
task/account pairs. Expand Resources or Fleet capacity details to see the deadline, sample coverage,
estimated fit and last recorded advice. Missing history remains unknown;
quota percentages are never converted into invented token allowances.
See [reset-aware scheduling](docs/RESET-AWARE-SCHEDULING.md).

Subscription windows and usage credits are separate. An exhausted Codex
subscription can still have credits: the sidebar shows current native units,
spending holds and an estimated dollar value for known personal plans.
Purchased credit balances do not become reset spend-down targets. Cloud-credit
estimates and tracked Devin ACUs do not establish an expiration. Expand
**Credit balances** for separate recorded API promotions, cloud gifts and
purchased balances, when available. API promotions show their verified expiry
date and conservative admission cutoff; their separate execution lane stays
held until billing, credential binding and signed API authority are verified.
A capture does not authorize spending. See [resource evidence](docs/RESOURCE-EVIDENCE.md#claude-api-promotional-grants).

Expand **Execution feedback** in Fleet for recorded producer outcomes, proposal
coverage and failure categories. A completed agent run is separate from verified
or shipped work. Exact failures without proposals become stable retros and
context for the Leader's existing planning loop. The panel reads shared local
records in the background; it opens without waiting for a scan or calling a
model. Select **View timeline** for bound verification, canonical GitHub PRs,
authenticated merge evidence and recorded post-merge checks. Unknown CI stays
visible beside local suite results; release and deployment remain unrecorded.
See [execution feedback](docs/EXECUTION-FEEDBACK.md).

Task fan-out has no fixed six-seat ceiling. Workspace retention defaults to 25;
`ASHLR_VERSE_AGENT_CAP=none` disables retention-driven automatic archiving, or
set a positive safe-integer capacity appropriate to your machine. Provider
quotas, local hardware, available ports and workspace isolation still apply.
Scheduling and cash-budget preferences no longer have the former preset UI
ceilings. The panel reports the current 64-item journal capacity per tick;
remaining work can continue on subsequent ticks.
The local module map, searchable model roster, efficiency plugin and phone
gateway remain available in both workflows.

The grant editor lets you review each listed account's enabled state, roles,
reserve and session ceiling. Set 0% reserve or No session ceiling explicitly
when appropriate; current usage, budget preferences and provider readiness still
determine eligibility. Editing a draft does not change the live grant.

An exhausted positive cash allowance keeps eligible resident subscription and
local work available without inventing dollar headroom. Actual metered or
unknown-cost work waits; explicit $0 remains the loop's Stop setting.

The read-only `ashlr openai-agents` CLI inspects managed OpenAI Agents session
metadata with a host-held API key. API access is separate from subscriptions,
and inventory does not qualify an execution seat. See the
[Agents integration guide](docs/OPENAI-AGENTS-INTEGRATION.md),
[Dots companion guide](docs/DOTS-COMPANION.md) and
[harness evolution plan](docs/AGENT-HARNESS-EVOLUTION.md) for the supported
commands and next integration steps.

| | What you get | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Talk to the Leader** | One conversation across Mind (⌘4), Telegram and `phm leader say`. Steer work, answer single-choice, multiple-choice or short-answer questions, and interject without losing a question draft. The Leader produces briefs and plans useful work using eligible connected resources under the active grant. | [LEADER.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/LEADER.md) |
| **Autonomy with custody** | A Touch ID standing grant names repos, engines, change-volume limits and spend. Verified changes follow gates G0–G7; eligible agents under a signed elite-direct policy land without a separate judge. Merges are SHA-pinned, watched and reverted if red. Work for me shows the current grant and rollout state. | [AUTHORITY.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/AUTHORITY.md) |
| **A multi-seat workbench** | Claude Code, several Codex accounts, Grok, local models and Devin side by side, each pinned to its own profile. Auto seat, Compare, cheap-first and one-click handoff across seats. A panel of Terminal (command blocks, an Agent tab), Browser (observation by default; guarded actions under a separate grant), Changes (a checkpoint before every turn, Accept/Reject, Undo/Redo), Sources and Reasoning, plus focus mode. | [VERSE.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md) |
| **Resources, ready or not** | ⌘. shows every account, local runtime, cloud credits and Devin, each with a "Chat: ready" and a "Fleet: ready · reserve kept" line and the command that fixes it. | [VERSE.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md#resources-the-drawer-and-the-bar-311) |
| **Cloud and Devin** | Hand a scoped task to a Claude Code cloud or Devin lane for a reported PR, or chat in a separate Devin cloud or CLI seat. The signed-in Devin CLI defaults to Cognition SWE-2 High; cloud sessions use ACUs and do not report an underlying model. Lane PRs reach Needs you and the standing gates. Cloud Devin needs two judge families; eligible local CLI work can use a signed elite-direct grant. | [CLOUD.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/CLOUD.md), [DEVIN.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/DEVIN.md) |
| **A private repo wiki** | A searchable local module map with dependencies and cited files, an architecture wiki per repo with verified `file:line` citations, and Ask the codebase. Pages are stored on your Mac; generation prefers local models, but may send repository context to Grok when the grant and repository policy allow it. | [VERSE.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md#repo-wiki-and-ask-315) |
| **Lessons** | Every task end becomes a retro with a root cause, swept hourly. Knowledge it suggests is used only after you approve it, and only where its scope matches. | [VERSE.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md#lessons-retros-and-approved-knowledge-315) |
| **Playbooks and automations** | Versioned task templates, run with a `!macro` in any chat or lane; issues, red builds, schedules and webhooks that become work, through each lane's own gates. | [VERSE.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md#playbooks-315) |
| **Jev decisions** | One fast, typed decision layer with a rules fallback at every call site, advisory or escalate-only where safety is near. | [VERSE.md](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md#the-jev-decision-layer-315) |

**Status, plainly.** Autonomy ships dormant and is macOS-only. It turns on
after you install the custody helper, sign a grant and start the resident
daemon. The signed grant defines its stages and repository scope; a shadow
stage proposes work without merging, while an eligible elite-direct stage can
land verified changes. A release that changes authority code pauses an existing grant until
Touch ID reapproval. Check the live grant, switch, Stop state and rollout stage
with `ashlr authority status`; a source document cannot establish that the
resident daemon is active on a particular Mac.

---

Each chat turn has a compact **Tools and context** panel showing reported calls,
MCP call counts, cited sources and recorded playbook references. The local Wiki
module map links inferred dependencies to checked source lines and reports scan
and resolver coverage. Both views use existing local evidence without additional
model calls.

## The desktop app (macOS)

The desktop app is a native window around Phantom, with a menu-bar item,
notifications while it is hidden, a Dock badge for Needs-you items and the
Terminal pane in the chat dock. It bundles the `ashlr` CLI, so it needs no
separate Node.js install to run.

### Install

Use [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/releases/latest)
for the original signed arm64 app archive and paired update manifest, rather
than a DMG. Match the artifacts to the installed CLI version and use the [desktop installation guide](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/desktop/README.md#install)
for the qualified update or maintainer artifact path. The app is locally signed,
not Apple Developer ID notarized, so macOS may require **Open Anyway** on first launch. To build from source on a
trusted macOS checkout, use the local release script with the stable
"Ashlr Local" code-signing identity. The prerequisites, exact build order and
verification steps are in [Releasing locally](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/RELEASING-LOCALLY.md)
and [Desktop app](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/VERSE.md#desktop-app-macos). In short, from a clean
repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build:binary
node desktop/scripts/prepare-sidecar.mjs
(cd desktop && CI=true cargo tauri build)
ashlr authority stop --json
# After the supported drain succeeds, quit the native app normally.
npm run ship:local -- --native
```

The guarded `ship:local --native` path handles a first install or an existing
verified app with the prebuilt native binary and local signature. It does not
compile Rust. Verify that it copied the new binary and that the installed app
reports this release. A bare `cargo tauri build` can wrap stale web assets.

### Open

The local build is signed with "Ashlr Local", not Apple Developer ID notarized.
macOS may still require right-click **Open** or **Open Anyway** on first launch.
The first signing setup may also ask for your login password and **Always Allow**
for the signing key. A small launch window says what is
happening while the bundled server starts on `127.0.0.1:7777`. The Phantom window
then opens with its tokens already handed over, so there is nothing to paste.
Closing the window hides it to the menu bar; **Quit** stops the server.

On first launch a two-minute tour shows which seats this Mac can use, whether
there is a local model, and the three ways to stop things.

### Sign in your seats

A seat is one account and the CLI that drives it, pinned to its own profile so a
turn can never land on the wrong account. Phantom never asks for or stores a
credential; each vendor CLI signs itself in.

1. **Prepare a private profile** for each account. For the Claude seat the cloud
   lane uses:

   ```sh
   ashlr resources profile prepare --provider claude \
     --directory ~/.ashlr/native-profiles/claude-a \
     --executable /absolute/path/to/the/claude/binary --json
   ```

   Use `--provider codex` or `--provider grok` for those accounts, with a new
   directory each time. Nothing is signed in yet.
2. **Sign in** with the `loginCommand` the command printed: `auth login
   --claudeai` for Claude, `login` for Codex, `--no-auto-update login --oauth`
   for Grok. Finish the vendor's browser flow as the intended account.
3. **List the account** in `~/.ashlr/account-connections/connections.json`,
   using the `command` from step 1:

   ```json
   {
     "schemaVersion": 1,
     "intervalMs": 30000,
     "accounts": [
       { "id": "claude-a", "label": "Claude Max", "provider": "claude",
         "command": ["/absolute/node", "/Users/you/.ashlr/native-profiles/claude-a/launcher.mjs"] }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Reopen Phantom.** The account appears as a seat in the composer and in
   **Apps & Accounts**, which shows its health, windows and resets. A background
   sweep checks every seat every 10 minutes with status commands only.
   **Reconnect** opens the seat's own login in Terminal.

Local models need no sign-in. If Ollama is running, every tag that supports tool
use becomes a local seat. The account commissioning details, including how to
check identity and quota, are in
[Resource Pools](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/RESOURCE-POOLS.md#commission-native-accounts-and-local-capacity).

---

## The CLI

The same console runs from the CLI on macOS, Linux and Windows. It needs Node.js
22.15 or newer and Git.

The canonical package provides `phm` as the primary CLI command. Both `phm` and
`ashlr` use the same workbench entrypoint; existing `ashlr` scripts keep working.
When building from source, `./install.sh` installs both aliases and refuses
unrelated files or links. The separate Phantom Secrets command remains `phantom`.

```sh
npm install -g @ashlr/phantom
phm --version
phm verse                 # start the server and open http://127.0.0.1:7777/verse/
```

The canonical package exposes `@ashlr/phantom`, `@ashlr/phantom/core`,
`@ashlr/phantom/types`, `@ashlr/phantom/plugin` and `@ashlr/phantom/universe`.
The published 3.25.3 compatibility package preserves the public SDK entrypoints `@ashlr/hub`,
`@ashlr/hub/core`, `@ashlr/hub/types`, `@ashlr/hub/plugin` and `@ashlr/hub/universe`.

`phm verse` prints two tokens. Paste the **read token** into the page once. It
asks for the **mutation token** the first time you start a chat or change
something. The server listens on `127.0.0.1` only, and neither token is written
to disk. `ashlr verse --no-open --json` prints one machine-readable line instead
of the banner.

What differs from the desktop app: the chat dock's Terminal pane needs the
desktop app's runtime (the browser gets **Open in Terminal.app** instead), and
the custody helper behind autonomy is macOS-only (a Secure Enclave key and Touch
ID).

---

## Quickstart

1. **Install** the desktop app or the CLI (above), and open Phantom.
2. **Sign in your seats** (above). Start `ollama serve` for local seats.
3. **Open a project.** **New chat** (⌘N) picks a seat and a folder; in the
   desktop app **Choose folder…** opens the native picker. Saving a folder as a
   project never enrolls it for unattended work.
4. **Chat.** The composer takes attachments, `@` files and `/` commands, and
   queues up to 3 turns while one runs. The context meter shows the selected
   window and compaction point when known; its tooltip identifies reported,
   catalog or default values. **Continue in a fresh chat** hands off with a
   note built without a model call. ⌘K reaches every chat, action and seat; ⌘J
   opens Needs you.
5. **Optionally run the local fast lane.** `ashlr local-runtime start --slots 4`
   starts llama-server with batching slots, and
   `ASHLR_VERSE_LOCAL_DISPATCH=llama-server` in the workbench's environment sends local
   turns to it. Model discovery stays on Ollama.
6. **Optionally hand work to the cloud or to Devin.** **New cloud task** on
   Command, or `ashlr cloud launch "<task>" --repo owner/name`
   ([cloud lane](#the-cloud-and-devin-lanes)). For Devin, `ashlr devin connect` once,
   then a **Devin (cloud)** chat, **Run in Devin** from a chat, or
   `ashlr devin launch "<task>"`.
7. **Talk to the Leader.** Open Mind (⌘4), or `ashlr leader say "focus: …"`.
   `ashlr comms setup-telegram` adds a two-way Telegram line.
8. **Inspect autonomy preparation** with `ashlr authority setup --dry-run --json`
   and `ashlr authority status`. Guided setup can prepare prerequisites after
   your explicit actions; once your standing grant is active,
   `ashlr authority resident start` runs the resident fleet under it.
   `ashlr authority protect --print` reviews GitHub changes. Updates preserve
   existing rules, rule options and check App pins; incompatible or unfamiliar
   top-level policies need review. Before writing, the updater rechecks all
   selected existing policies and checks each again before its update. These
   checks reduce the race window; they are not an atomic GitHub transaction.

---

## Autonomy

Autonomy ships **dormant** and is macOS-only: nothing runs until you install the
custody helper, sign a Touch ID standing grant and start the resident daemon
yourself. Inspect it with `ashlr authority setup --dry-run` and
`ashlr authority status`. The full commissioning path, grant limits and budget
modes are in [Autonomy setup](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/AUTONOMY-SETUP.md).

Verse 3.16 changes authority code. After installing, reapprove an existing
grant with `ashlr authority re-approve` and restart the resident service from
your terminal. Check its actual state with `ashlr authority resident status`;
source documentation cannot establish that it is active on a particular Mac.

---

## Resources, on every page

Press **⌘.** (or click the tab on the right edge, or run "Open Resources" from ⌘K) to open the Resources drawer:
connected resources grouped by their legacy display tier. **Elite**, **Fast**
and **Free · local** are labels, not quality or speed measurements. Shared seat
selection ranks eligible resources by current headroom and independent funding,
without inferring quality from a provider or model family. Cards show the available account, model,
billing and readiness evidence; unknown readings stay unknown. Chat sign-in,
quota collection and fleet authority are separate checks. The drawer opens over
your work or pins beside it. See [resource evidence](docs/RESOURCE-EVIDENCE.md)
for the meaning of each reading.

The **resource bar** keeps account allowances, separate credit balances and local
resources in view. Saved Grok Bot profiles have their own reorderable entries;
their allowance, reset and dispatch remain unverified and never inherit Grok
Build usage. Hover a row for its evidence, or click it to inspect the resource.

## Working on Phantom itself

```sh
npm run gate          # minutes, not half an hour: static checks + the tests your change can reach
npm run ship:local -- --native  # after a native build: guarded Phantom.app/current CLI migration; requires prior drain + normal Quit
```

For a canonical release, qualify one exact candidate and publish its original
CI tarball through the commissioned trusted-publishing workflow. Finalizing and
installing the signed desktop remains separate. `npm run gate:full` runs every suite. See
[`docs/RELEASING-LOCALLY.md`](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/RELEASING-LOCALLY.md).

## The cloud and Devin lanes

Phantom can hand a task to a **Claude Code cloud session** (`ashlr cloud launch
"<task>"`) or, off by default, to **Devin** (`ashlr devin connect`, then
`ashlr devin launch "<task>"`). Each task is asked to deliver one draft PR, and
nothing in the cloud lane merges. Overview: [Cloud and Devin lanes](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/CLOUD-LANES.md);
details: [`docs/CLOUD.md`](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/CLOUD.md) and [`docs/DEVIN.md`](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/DEVIN.md).

The local Devin CLI seat defaults to Cognition SWE-2 High; the ACU-metered cloud
seat does not identify its underlying model. Cloud Devin still needs the signed
stage and two independent judge families for a merge. Eligible CLI work can
use a separately signed elite-direct ceiling.

## Benchmarks and traces

Run no model to inspect help or compare compatible saved reports:

```sh
ashlr benchmark --help
ashlr benchmark --compare-reports BASELINE.json CANDIDATE.json
```

Run a synthetic coding task explicitly against your configured local runtime:

```sh
ashlr benchmark run --task multi-file-rename --trials 1 --concurrency 1 --out report.json
```

The harness records checker results, runtime configuration, wall time, usage
coverage and private request traces. Failed coding tasks return a failing exit
status. Comparisons require matching tasks, runtime configuration and recorded
cache conditions; missing token counts stay unknown. These are tools for
measuring changes, and do not add an eval gate to fleet dispatch.

Review real project changes in the chat's Changes panel, alongside reported tool
calls and source evidence. See the [harness guide](docs/AGENT-HARNESS-EVOLUTION.md#evidence-without-a-new-dispatch-gate)
for offline and online boundaries, trace privacy and comparison details.

## Reference

The Phantom kernel underneath the console (the Universe experiment kernel, resource pools,
the legacy enrolled-repository fleet and its activation runbook, the kill
switch, backends, sandboxing, the command reference, the safety model, the
`~/.ashlr/` layout and configuration) is documented in
[Phantom reference](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/HUB-REFERENCE.md). Start with the
[executable Universe demo](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/DEMO.md), which needs no model account.

CLI archives are built by hosted CI. As a dated release example, the commissioned trusted publisher published
`@ashlr/phantom@3.29.7` on October 10, 2026 in [run 38025950740, attempt 1](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/actions/runs/38025950740/attempts/1),
with public registry-byte, provenance, consumer and `latest` checks. The signed
macOS app was finalized and installed separately from the same qualified source.
See the [release procedure](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/RELEASING-LOCALLY.md).
The [public website](https://phm.dev) shows the Phantom workbench; [Phantom Secrets](https://phm.dev/secrets) has its own page.
Automatic website publisher commissioning and connected-provider activation remain separate acceptance steps.
A legacy `@ashlr/hub` response does not prove canonical publication.
GitHub release assets require their own public download and checksum verification;
repository or changelog state alone is not publication evidence.

## The Phantom ecosystem

Phantom is the flagship workbench. These related open-source projects solve
different parts of a developer's workflow and remain useful on their own:

Explore the [interactive ecosystem page](https://verse.ashlr.ai/ecosystem) for a
dated, GitHub-sourced star history of these six repositories and their sum.

| Project | What it helps with |
|---------|--------------------|
| **[Phantom](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom)** | Coordinate coding agents, accounts, local models and guarded fleet work from one console. |
| **[Phantom Secrets](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom-secrets)** | Manage credentials; configured token/proxy paths can keep real keys out of agent context. API adapters may still reveal a key in-process for a call. |
| **[Locus](https://github.com/ashlrai/locus)** | Check configured account and session identity; its off, warn, enforce and firm modes have different effects. |
| **[Lexicon](https://github.com/ashlrai/lexicon)** | Correct names and technical terms that speech-to-text gets wrong before they reach an agent. |
| **[AshlrCode](https://github.com/ashlrai/ashlrcode)** | Run a multi-provider coding agent in the terminal. |
| **[Morphkit](https://github.com/ashlrai/morphkit)** | Turn a TypeScript/React app into a SwiftUI project. |

The [ecosystem map](https://github.com/ashlrai/phantom/blob/master/docs/ECOSYSTEM-MAP.md) records older composition ideas; it
is a dated planning snapshot, not a claim that every integration is live. Each
repository has its own install instructions, release state and star count.
