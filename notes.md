# Implementation findings

No drive command, driver daemon, metrics command, restock implementation or publish.sh exists in this checkout. Use an explicit versioned local file contract until the driver lands. Reuse fleet CLI dispatch and fleet digest aggregation. Keep transport responsibility with Masbot. Protected paths were inspected read-only.

# Routing implementation notes

- Existing src/core/decide/decide.ts provides Jev confidence, accounting, budget and kill controls.
- src/cli/route.ts currently supports route explain only.
- docs/ROUTING.md does not yet exist.
- dispatchd.py writes dispatchd.admission.v2 at end of tick.
- No companion MCP tools called.
# Onboarding findings

- Existing `onboard` first-activation and `setup` authority flows must retain their contracts.
- `phantom status --json` is configuration metadata, not vault health. Names-only
  `phantom list --json` refuses a locked file vault; partial keychain inventories
  carry a warning. Never turn a failed inventory into empty.
- Secrets import requires a trusted-terminal challenge. Offer password-manager,
  provider and other-vault imports without accepting exports or credential values.
- Lexicon supports `lexicon add <term>`; Stack MCP registers its existing CLI,
  not service provisioning. Ashlr MD has no npm/Homebrew package.
- Use existing connector metadata validation and safe-path checks. Register local
  MCP executables only; never copy credential-bearing MCP commands or environments.
- Companion tools called: none. Phantom CLI bootstrap, docs, MCP/wire/authority
  inspections were run as required by docs/AGENT-MCP-CLI.md. No runtime activated.
